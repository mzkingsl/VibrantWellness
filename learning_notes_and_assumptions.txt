- go:
    - go mod init <module_name>
        - it does two things:
            1. creates go.mod in project root, declaring <module_name>
            as the unique base import path for all packages
            2. turn's on Go's module system, so that when I import external
            libraries, Go will automatically record versions and fetch them
